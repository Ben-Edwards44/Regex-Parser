# Regex-Parser

A hand-crafted regular expression parser written in Go.

## How it works

It's just a finite state machine innit (I'll write this section later...)

## TODO

- [ ] Use lockstep algorithm for evaluating finite state machines
- [ ] Make an actual good interface that is not just print statements
- [ ] Finish this readme
- [ ] Fix bug with `a(b?)+`
