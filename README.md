# Regex-Parser

A hand-crafted regular expression parser written in Go.

## How it works

It's just a finite state machine innit (I'll write this section later...)

## TODO

[ ] Add support for `|` and `.` characters in regex strings
[ ] Make an actual good interface that is not just print statements
[ ] Finish this readme
